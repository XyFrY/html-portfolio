        <h3>Escape Room</h3>
        <p>
        I have done this for the past 2 semester. The first semeseter I helped out
        making Game Show theme of the Escape Room. I helped out by cutting out the pieces and
        screw them together. Also helped in the coloring process. Last semester I
        did the same thing as last time but also designed a small puzzle for the 
        Alien Invasion theme.

        <!-- Education and Experience-->
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>Sandra Day O'Connor High School (2018-2022)</h3>
        <p>
        I do not have a lot to say. When I was a junior, I took an introduction course
        of coding. I learned the mere basics of coding by using Code.org. In the class 
        they taught us a little about using html and css. 
        Senior year I took an intermediate coding class. Learned a little of java script
        but forgotted all about it. 
        </p>
        <h3>Northern Arizona University (2022 - )</h3>
        <p>
        I started in Fall 2022 and <del>majored in Applied Computer Science</del> took no coding class until Spring 2023. 
        MatLabs was the first coding class I took at NAU. In the Fall 2023 I changed <del>my major to Immersive Media and Games (IMG)</del>. 
        Also in Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 I took CS126 and CS136. This was probably the most I've worked on coding and I still have a lot to learn. 
        In Fall 2024, I tried to take CS249 and CS212. I did not succeed and dropped my IMG courses and <mark>switched to
        University Studies</mark>. Didn't do anything in the Sping 2025 but did a lot of thinking. Now
        I am back in Fall 2025 to try and finish this class so I can atleast prove to myself
        I can actually put in the effort and pass this course unlike last time.
        </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
        I have no work experince related to programming/coding.
        I do have experince in the workforce but I do not think it has any
        relevence to this. So this will be left out.
